## The main functions of ISHAK cheat

1 Memory Aimbot is one of the main functions of ISHAK Cheat. It allows you to automatically be brought to targets and enemies, making your shooting more accurate. You can quickly and easily deal with opponents, not giving them a single chance.

2 ESP Box and ESP Snaplines are two additional functions that will help you see where your enemies are.

3 Visible Check is another important function that allows you to check if enemies see you. If you are in the enemy visibility zone, the cheat automatically activates additional opportunities, such as “No Spread” and “No Recoil”.

4 Rapid Fire - a function that increases the speed of firing from weapons. It is especially useful in the Royal Battle mode, when you need to quickly deal with opponents and take a leading position.

5 No Spread - a function that reduces the spread of bullets during firing. This allows you to more accurately hit the target at large distances and conduct effective shooting.

6 Spinbot is a function that allows you to quickly rotate around your own axis. This will help you avoid hits from opponents and make you a more difficult goal for shooting.

7 Instarevive is the function of instant resurrection after death. It allows you to quickly return to the game and continue the struggle for survival.

8 AIRSTUCK - a function thanks to which you can stand still in the air. This gives you the opportunity to shoot more effectively at enemy and avoid hits.

9 ADS in Air is a unique function that adds the possibility of using the aiming mode in the air. Now you can shoot at enemies, even being in the air!

10 Crosshair is the last but no less important function of the Chita. She adds a sight to your screen, which facilitates aiming and firing even more precisely.
